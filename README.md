#### Practicing Machine Learning

##### Introduction

The goal of this repository is to implement machine learning algorithms as taught in the 
[Coursera Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). In order 
to focus on the *machine learning* aspect, I chose not not to spend time
on the (very important) step of *feature engineering*. Instead I use publicly available code to 
pre-process the raw data before submitting it to my algorithms. The source for any data wrangling 
code I use is available in the *data_clean_name.py* files.
 
To test my code I use various Kaggle *getting started* prediction competitions:

* Logistic Regression: [Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

<br>


##### Logistic Regression

My goal was to implementation logistic regression using **regularized Gradient Descent**. Further, In order 
to evaluate the algorithm I implemented:
 
 * a **cost history curve** to ensure that cost correctly converges to a minimum 
 * a **learning curve** to analyze the algorithm in terms of *bias* and *variance*

<br>

##### Results

* Titanic Logistic Regression: 0.75 accuracy and leaderboard position 9779 (as of 07/2018)
